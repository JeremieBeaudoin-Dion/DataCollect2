# Sensors Data Logger #

This is a simple application to allow the easy capture of IMU and other sensor data on Android devices for offline use.
I wanted to play around with data from various sensors such as IMU in Android Studio 3.4.2, API level 26 for Android devices.

The aspects of the IMU that you can log follow directly from the Core Motion documentation provided by Apple.
For more details, see the Android developer documentation [here](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/sensors/sensors_motion).
